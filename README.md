##### **A Statquest implementation of [Neural Networks Pt. 4: Multiple Inputs and Outputs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83LYR-1IcjA&list=PLblh5JKOoLUIxGDQs4LFFD--41Vzf-ME1&index=9)** see the video to better understand the process of this repo
##### **Also a implementation of [Neural Networks Part 5: ArgMax and SoftMax](https://youtu.be/KpKog-L9veg?si=ue6ZtYQ0npXg6O7t)**
## Description
This project explores the underlying mathematics of neural networks by implementing a simple classifier for the Iris dataset with manually set weights and biases. See each calculation with Linear and ReLU to see the math behind the model.

## TLDR
**A custom Neural network but instead of traning it i manually set the parameters to see the data flow through the model to see the underlying math.**

## Project Overview

Rather than allowing a neural network to learn weights through training, this project:
- Sets weights and biases manually
- Implements custom linear transformations and ReLU activation functions
- Visualizes decision boundaries in 3D space
- Demonstrates how each component affects the final classification results

## Neural Network Architecture

The model has a simple architecture:
- **Input Layer**: 2 nodes (petal_width, sepal_width)
- **Hidden Layer**: 2 nodes with ReLU activation
- **Output Layer**: 3 nodes (one for each Iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Custom Implementation Details

The neural network uses:

1. **Manual Weight Initialization**:
   ```python
   # First layer weights and biases
   weights1 = [[-2.5, 0.6],
               [-1.5, 0.4]]
   bias1 = [1.6, 0.7]
   
   # Second layer weights and biases
   weights2 = [[-0.1, 1.5],
               [2.4, -5.2],
               [-2.2, 3.7]]
   bias2 = [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
   ```

2. **Custom Linear Transformation**:
   - Matrix multiplication of inputs with weights
   - Addition of bias term
   
3. **Custom ReLU Activation**:
   - Element-wise function that returns max(0, x)
   - Implemented manually to show the computation

## Visualizations

The project includes comprehensive 3D visualizations showing:
- Probability surfaces for each class
- Decision boundaries between the three species
- How the feature space is divided based on the manually selected weights

## Key Insights

This implementation demonstrates:
- How matrix operations and activation functions transform data through the network
- The impact of specific weight values on classification boundaries
- How a simple network with just 2 inputs and 2 hidden neurons can effectively separate the Iris classes
- The mathematical operations underlying "black box" neural networks
